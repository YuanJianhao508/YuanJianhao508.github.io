I am a DPhil (PhD) student of University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Daniele De Martini](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/daniele-de-martini/), [Prof. Paul Newman](https://www.ori.ox.ac.uk/people/paul-newman/), [Prof. Philip Torr](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/), [Prof. Lars Kunze](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/lars-kunze/), and [Dr. Matt Gadd](https://mttgdd.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Science also at University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and [Prof. Clive Siviour](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/clive-siviour/). I am fortunate to collaborate closely with Dr. Francesco Pinto, [Dr. Shuyang Sun](https://kevin-ssy.github.io/) at Torr Vision Group, University of Oxford. My research interest lies in multimodal generative modeling for robotics tasks.

<!-- Test Tese. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
